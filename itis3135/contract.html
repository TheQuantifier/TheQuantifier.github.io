    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>
      I, John A. Hand agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2025,
      ITIS3135, Web-Based Application Design & Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all
      work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not
      put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I
      also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for
      class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that
      given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or
      even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
      and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external
      libraries) and never from my classmates.
