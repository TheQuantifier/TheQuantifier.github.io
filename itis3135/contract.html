    <h2>Course Contract</h2>
    <p>
      I, John A. Hand, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2025
      ITIS 3135 Web-Based Application Design & Development course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
      I understand that all work I do on publicly available online tools will be accessible to the world,
      and I will not post information that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private.
      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or physical presence.
      Therefore, failure to turn in assignments may appear as absences.
      Finally, given the structure of this class and the abundance of online examples,
      I pledge to use outside resources only to learn—not to copy—and will credit all external code sources appropriately.
    </p>
