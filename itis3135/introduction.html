      <p>
        I enjoy building clean web pages, prototyping simple games, and spending time outdoors.
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me hiking, swimming, or digging into a good
        conversation about math or design.

        I’ve held several campus roles (e.g., RA and student leadership positions) and regularly
        tutor math. I focus on organization, clarity, and creating helpful resources for others.

      <p>
        I once spent hours tuning a game character’s walk cycle, only to realize the real issue
        was that the sun in the scene was pointing straight down. The fix? Rotate the sun.
